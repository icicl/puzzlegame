# INSTRUCTIONS
The goal is to mark squares in the grid so that each row and each column have the specified number of squares marked.
Every square has to be next to (in one of the eight adjacent squares) a green square, and every green square has to have at least one marked square next to it.

# CONTROLS
Left click on a square to mark it.  Right click on a square to flag it as empty (this has no effect and is optional, it just makes it easier to fill in the remaining squares).  Left click on a column or row heading to flag all unmarked squares in that column/row.  Middle click a row/column heading to clear all flags in that row/column.  Clicking the top left square or the `clear board` button will remove all marks and flags from the board.  The `new game` button generates a new board and deletes the current one.
